# Amiga-Sinewave-Scroller

It's been a long time since my active Amiga days, so.. forgive.. :-)

The code could be optimized a lot.

Anyway, in the hidden CHIP mem area there's is a blitter scroll, from where the sinewave effect is made with the 68040's CPU and its FPU.

For clearing the screen the code uses 68040's move16 instruction.

Short GIF-animation of the app:
